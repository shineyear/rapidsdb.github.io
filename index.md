# What is RapidsDB?

RapidsDB is a fully parallel, distributed, in-memory federated query system that is designed to support
complex analytical SQL queries running against a set of different data stores.

RapidsDB provides unified SQL access to a wide variety of data sources, which can include relational and
non-relational data sources. Data can be joined across all of the data sources.
