# MPP Engine

---

RapidsDB is a distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing), shared-nothing, in-memory database.

RapidsDB has its own fully parallel MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) execution engine, which is responsible for executing query plans generated by the RapidsDB SQL Compiler and Optimizer.  The MPP execution engine will access the underlying data sources through the RapidsDB Federation Connectors.

MOXE (in-Memory Operational eXtreme Engine) is a parallel, fully distributed, internal memory data store that is co-resident with RapidsDB, sharing the same process space as the other RapidsDB components. MOXE uses hash partitioning to distribute the data across multiple partitions, and each partition operates in parallel when delivering data to the Execution Engine.
