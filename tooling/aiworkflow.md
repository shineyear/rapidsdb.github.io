# AIworkflow

---

AIworkflow, the core technology of ParallelAI, is a unified AI management platform that significantly simplifies the machine learning modeling process.

* It provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface for both developers and business users to experiment, build, train and deploy machine learning models without requiring any specific programming skills
* It provides a unified modeling platform, which integrates multiple machine learning and deep learning frameworks
* It covers the whole data modeling lifecycle, which includes data ingestion, preparation, modeling, training, testing, evaluation, deployment and prediction
* It provides a process management component, Project, to increase the reusability and portability of the modeling process
* It provides a modeling management component, Model, to support automatic model contrast and make parameter tuning and model deployment more convenient

With AIworkflow, model building, testing, and deployment time can be greatly reduced as well as the IT O&M cost. It helps modern corporations improve data modeling efficiency, maximize productivity, optimize customer experience and boost data-driven innovation, speeding up business decisions and making it possible to monetize data value in real time.
